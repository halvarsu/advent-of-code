x = (T - t0) * v
v = t0
x = T t0 - t0^2 > r
    - t0^2 + T t0 - r > 0
t0^2 - T t0 + r < 0

I.e., x crosses r when t0 is
t_c = (T +- sqrt(T^2 - 4r)) / 2

Testing t0 = T, which is in the middle of the two solutions,
gives x = 0 < r.

I.e. solutions are given by integer values of t0 in the interval
(T - sqrt(T^2 - 4r)) / 2 < t0 < (T + sqrt(T^2 - 4r)) / 2
